# üßÆ Numpy_starter

Welcome to the **Mastering Data Analysis and Computation with NumPy** project. This repository contains a series of exercises that illustrate the power and versatility of the NumPy library in Python. The exercises range from basic array manipulation to advanced operations such as broadcasting, vectorization, and linear algebra. This project aims to demonstrate the importance of NumPy in scientific computing and data analysis, making it a fundamental tool for any data scientist or analyst.

## üìö Project Overview

This project is divided into two main sections:

1. **Introduction to NumPy**: Covers foundational concepts, including array creation, basic operations, and statistical functions.
2. **Advanced NumPy Techniques**: Explores advanced topics such as broadcasting, vectorized operations, linear algebra functions, and more complex data manipulation techniques.

The notebooks are designed to build a strong understanding of how NumPy optimizes computations and facilitates data handling.

## üìå Introduction

NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides efficient support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a comprehensive collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. The primary objective of this project is to exemplify the significance of NumPy in computational tasks and to provide practical exercises to develop proficiency in using this library.

## ü§î Why Use NumPy?

NumPy enables efficient numerical operations and data manipulation due to its powerful array structures and broadcasting capabilities. With NumPy, you can:

- Perform element-wise operations efficiently.
- Leverage broadcasting for array manipulation without explicit loops.
- Use linear algebra functions for matrix operations.
- Simplify complex data manipulations with built-in functions.
- Integrate seamlessly with other scientific libraries such as Pandas and SciPy.

This project provides a practical demonstration of these capabilities through targeted exercises.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`NumPy_Ejercicios.ipynb`**: This notebook includes exercises on fundamental NumPy concepts, such as creating arrays, performing mathematical operations, and using statistical functions.
  
- **`Numpy_Avanzado.ipynb`**: This notebook explores more advanced topics, such as broadcasting, vectorized operations, linear algebra computations, and advanced data manipulation techniques.

## üîç Key Concepts and Techniques

### **Basic NumPy Operations:**

- **Array Creation**: Using `np.array()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, and `np.arange()` for array creation.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using `np.add()`, `np.subtract()`, `np.multiply()`, and `np.divide()`.
- **Statistical Functions**: Using `np.mean()`, `np.median()`, `np.std()` for statistical analysis.

### **Advanced NumPy Operations:**

- **Broadcasting**: Applying operations to arrays of different shapes and sizes without explicit loops.
- **Vectorized Operations**: Leveraging `np.vectorize()` for efficient computations.
- **Linear Algebra**: Solving systems of equations and performing matrix operations using `np.linalg`.
- **Advanced Indexing and Slicing**: Using advanced indexing techniques to select and manipulate data.
