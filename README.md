# NumPy_starter 

Welcome to **NumPy_starter**, a project dedicated to exploring the foundational concepts and exercises related to the powerful **NumPy** library in Python. This collection of exercises is a part of my journey through a data analytics bootcamp, where I focused on learning:

### What I've Learned:
- **Creating NumPy Arrays**: How to create and manipulate arrays of different shapes and sizes.
- **Basic Math Operations**: Doing element-wise operations and using NumPy’s built-in functions for math tasks.
- **Indexing and Slicing**: Accessing and modifying specific parts of arrays.
- **Statistics**: Using functions like `mean()`, `median()`, and `std()` to get insights from data.
- **Linear Algebra**: Working with matrix operations and solving systems of equations.

Through these exercises, I have developed a deeper understanding of how NumPy optimizes array-based computation, making it a fundamental tool for numerical and data science tasks.

## Most Used Functions per Exercise

1. **Introduction to Arrays**:
   - `np.array()`: Create arrays.
   - `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`: Generate arrays filled with zeros or ones.
   - `np.arange()`: Create an array with a range of values.
   
2. **Basic Math**:
   - `np.add()`, `np.subtract()`: Add or subtract arrays.
   - `np.multiply()`, `np.divide()`: Element-wise multiplication and division.
   - `np.power()`: Raise elements to a power.

3. **Indexing and Slicing**:
   - Basic slicing (`array[start:stop]`) to select parts of an array.
   - Fancy indexing: Access elements using index arrays.
   - Boolean indexing: Select elements based on conditions.

4. **Statistics**:
   - `np.mean()`: Calculate the average of an array.
   - `np.median()`: Find the median.
   - `np.std()`: Calculate the standard deviation.

5. [ ] To Do:
